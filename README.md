[Application Used: Bullet Graph and Reference Line, Filter, Marks Card]<br>
The purpose of this analysis is to gain insights into the salaries offered to data scientists by various companies. The above bullet graph depicts the top ten companies that offer the highest compensation to data scientists. The x-axis of the graph represents the base salary, while the y-axis indicates the company names. The graph incorporates a rank filter, indicating the rank of each company in terms of the salary offered to data scientists. Additionally, a job title filter is added to select the data scientist job role. The graph reveals that Google offers the highest salary for data scientists, followed by Amazon, Facebook, and eBay. A reference line is included in the chart, dividing the graph into two equal parts based on the average salary. The average base salary of all ten companies is approximately 1813900USD. Comparing the average salary with that of each company demonstrates that Google, Amazon, Facebook, and eBay offer the highest salaries. It is important to note that there is a significant difference in wages offered by Google compared to the second-highest company. However, the salaries of the other nine companies do not differ significantly. By changing the job role filters, one can explore the salaries offered by different companies for various job roles.<br>

[Application Used: Scatter Plot and Set, Filter, Marks Card]<br>
This analysis provides insights into the salary ranges offered by different companies based on years of experience. The scatter plot graph depicts the correlation between salary and experience, with Facebook offering the highest compensation for 21 years of experience and Envision LLC providing the lowest pay for one year of experience. The x-axis represents base salary, while the y-axis represents years of experience. To provide a clearer view of the data, a set was created to show salaries offered by different companies for more than five years of experience, with a box representing the range and a circle showing any outliers. This set enables us to understand the salary range for a specific range of experience. By adjusting the settings, we can analyze the salaries offered for different fields such as more than five years or less than five years of experience. It's important to note that companies offer different salary ranges for various years of experience, and there is no specific way to analyze base salaries for additional years of experience. Other factors like skills and requirements might also influence wages.<br>
