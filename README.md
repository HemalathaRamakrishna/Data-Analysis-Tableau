[Application Used: Bullet Graph and Reference Line, Filter, Marks Card]<br>
This analysis helps us understand the salaries offered in different companies for the data scientist role. The above bullet graph shows the top ten companies that pay the highest compensation to data scientists. The graph’s x-axis is the base salary, and the chart’s y-axis is company names. A rank filter is added to the graph. The numbers on the graph show the company’s rank according to the salary offered to data scientists. A filter on the job title is added to the chart to select the data scientist job role. The above graph shows that Google has the highest salary for a data 13 scientist, followed by Amazon, Facebook, and eBay. A reference line is added to the graph, which divides the chart into two equal parts based on the average salary. Out of the ten companies, the average salary of all ten companies is approximately around 1813900USD sum in base salary. Comparing the average salary of these ten companies and the salary of the individual company shows that Google, Amazon, Facebook, and eBay offer the highest salaries. The salary offered by Google is much higher than the average salary of all ten companies. There is a significant difference in wages provided by the top tenth and second-highest companies. If we compare the result of the other nine companies, there is not much difference in the range of salary offered. Similarly, the job role filters can be changed to see the salaries offered in different companies for different job roles.<br>
